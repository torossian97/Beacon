## The Motivation

I made this app during my time as the software lead, and co-founder, of the UBC Medical Innovation Student Team. It, along with the amazing work of the rest of the team, got us to the finals of the Johns Hopkins Biomedical Innovation Competition.

The idea behind Beacon was to combine our love of hardware, software, and machine learning with a cause we cared about. The 15 members of the team worked tirelessly to created a wearable that tracked things such as:

- Galvanic skin resistance
- Heart Rate
- Body temparature

This wearable then attached to the Beacon app. Using Machine Learning algorithms, the team managed to predict stress in a person to a reasonable degree.

Beacon also served to deliver mindfulness and stress-reduction excercises when stress was detected, as well as provide histocial records of biometrics and predictive data.
